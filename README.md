# Go Bike Go

Inspired by the app [WABA](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/where-a-bike-at-citibike-nyc/id689093812?mt=8) (where a bike at?), Go Bike Go is meant to allow users to quikly find Citibikes on their commute. Users create a profile with their home and work addresses and can easily see bike and bike dock availability at the endpoints of their commute.
